St John at the London Review Bookshop Cafés Bloomsbury price 2 of 4 4 out of 5 stars Recommended Image: Matthew Hague What is it: A casual Bloomsbury bakehouse outpost of the acclaimed restaurant. Why we love it: Taking over the London Review Bookshop cafe in the shadow of the British Museum, this iteration of St John is by far its most lowkey, with just 10 tables and a menu primarily focussing on pastries and joyfully utilitarian doorstop sandwiches. Sweet-toothed punters will be pleased as the whole of the St John Bakery is on offer, with all manner of pastries, Eccles cakes, madeleines , and doughnuts, as well as warm savoury bakes (ham or courgette tart, pig cheek or potato and Wigmore cheese pie) and a short but salutary wine list. And of course there is coffee. Order this: St John’s bake-to-order madeleines are renowned; with a cup of something warming and a book from next door, we can’t think of a better way to spend an hour. Address: 16 Bury Place, Bloomsbury, WC1A 2JL. Opening hours: Mon-Sat 8am-6.30pm, Sun 12-6pm. Read review 4.

Why we love it: Bolland & Crust, located in an industrial park, might not look like much but its food means business. Having operated since 2009 as caterers, this north London outpost is their first sit-down eatery, but with an MO centred around bbq and spit-roast treats (overseen by the friendly hog painted on its wall). They know exactly what they’re good at: namely, no nonsense breakfast baps and fry ups, and an exciting lunch menu that’s already luring in locals and those from far beyond. Expect big flavours, like pigs head croquettes and chimichurri-laden bavette steak; on Sundays they roast, with belly pork, lamb shoulder and bbq cauliflower all on offer. Order this: The croquettes with tangy sauce gribiche are a menu staple, as are their super crispy, layered confit potato cakes. Address: Crawley Road Studios, 38 Crawley Road, Wood Green, N22 6AG Opening hours: Wed-Thu 10am-3pm, Fri 9am-3pm and 5-9pm, Sat 9am-4pm, Sun 10am-4pm. 6.

Nan’s living room vibes in a quirky Lewisham tearoom.,"Nan’s living room vibes in a quirky Lewisham tearoom.
Why we love it
: The Copper Tea’s exterior
may say ‘New Cross Appliance Centre’, but rest assured there’s a tiny little café serving banging breakfasts and a
strong cuppa in quirky china
behind those quaint floral curtains. Head in and find an oh-so-cute space with mismatched picture frames, plenty of lace and the general vibe of days gone by. The menu, meanwhile, brings The Copper Tea up to date, combining British and Japanese dishes from eggs and soldiers to bento boxes.","Ground Floor, 137 Lewisham Way, Lewisham, SE14 6QF.",,,"Mon, Wed-Thu 10.30am-4pm, Tues, Fri 11am-4pm, Sat-Sun 10.30am-3.30pm.

Read review 14. Burnt Cafés Shepherd’s Bush 4 out of 5 stars Recommended Emma Louise Pudge What is it: Innovative offerings and outdoor seating in Shepherd’s Bush. Why we love it: With bright, minimal interiors and outdoor seating in its rear garden (and a front bench too!), Burnt makes the most of its relatively teeny space. But even more impressive than its feng shui is its menu, which spices up the classic brunch offering with cheeky twists like a salt beek, sauerkraut and emmental croque monsieur, or a salmon and kimchi omelette. On Fridays, they open for dinner, serving a rotating menu of seasonal small plates, while Burnt imports its beans from east London favourites Climpson & Sons, and pastries from the Dusty Knuckle. Order this: Why go for boring old eggs and toast when you could opt for a brunch-time spiced chicken schnitzel caesar, served with a fried egg and parmesan. Address: 163 Askew Road, Shepherd’s Bush, W12 9AU. Opening hours: Mon-Sat 8am-4pm, Sun 9am-4pm, Fridays only 6pm - 10pm. Read review Advertising 15. The Elder Press Cafe Hammersmith 4 out of 5 stars Recommended Elder Press Cafe What is it: A spacious spot for leisurely lunching on the Hammersmith riverside. Why we love it: Being slightly out of the way affords this riverside café a breezy two floors and a courtyard, where buckets of natural light ripple through some very tasteful Crittall-style windows and a dusky pink, plant-filled interior. Food here is as important as the coffee (which comes from Ozone). The ever-rotating, totally seasonal menu ranges from kimchi fried rice to Turkish eggs with labneh, plus freshly-baked daily pastries. This is a spot where you can easily whittle away a few hours, just be warned: you’ll be surrounded by what sometimes feels like every labrador and their yoga pants-clad owner in west London. Order this: Elder Press’ signature brunch will tick all your nutritional boxes, with hot smoked salmon, soft boiled egg, pickled veg, rye bread and more. Address: 3 South Black Lion Lane, Hammersmith, W6 9TJ. Opening hours: Mon-Fri 8.30am-5pm, Sat-Sun 9am-5pm. Read review 16. Cafe Palestina Cafés Kentish Town price 1 of 4 4 out of 5 stars Recommended What is it: A social enterprise and neighbourhood cafe selling Palestinian fare and produce. Why we love it: Set up in 2017 as a way to promote and support Palestinian culture and community, there’s no better time to take a trip to Café Palestina. They sell crafts (pottery, soap, textiles) and produce (stock up on their olive oil), while at lunch they offer a full menu of traditional mezze, soups, wraps and cakes. From Wednesday to Friday, meanwhile, they also host regular evening events: Wednesday is a Palestinian discussion group, Thursday is vegan night, while on Fridays they serve up a three-course Palestinian dinner as part of a supper club. Order this: A sharer for two, their Hearty Feast does what it says on the tin, with hummus, muttabal, vine leaves, grilled halloumi and more. Address: 53 Fortess Road, Kentish Town, NW5 1AD. Opening hours: Tue-Sat 11am-5pm and 7pm-10pm, Sun 11am-5pm. Read review Advertising 17. Lowry & Baker Cafés Portobello Road price 1 of 4 4 out of 5 stars Recommended Photograph: Rob Grieg What is it: A charmingly decorated, quality café on Portobello Road. Why we love it: All light wooden finish and quaint decorative touches, Lowry & Baker is the definition of a cute, west London neighbourhood café. Coffee comes from Monmouth, while their menu is wider and more varied than most similar spots. Pancakes, muffins and fry-ups tick the classic brunch box, but there’s also tortilla wraps, salad bowls and a vegan massaman curry to choose from. Having recently extended their space, there’s more room to pull up a chair too. Order this: Their speciality drinks extend beyond merely a ubiquitous matcha latte. Try a ginger beetroot velvet latte or, even more intriguingly, their mermaid latte, made with butterfly pea flower. Address: 339-341 Portobello Road, Notting Hill, W10 5SA. Opening hours: Daily 8am-4.30pm. Read review Been there, done that? Think again, my friend.
